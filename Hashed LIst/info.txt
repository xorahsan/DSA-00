Hashed List Collision Handling Types:
    01) Open Addressing
    02) Chain Separting

Open Addressing:
Editing/Extending/Deleting/Updating Array but work in hash table only
(Note that we can increase table size by copying old data if needed)

Chain Separting:
making a linked list with every element having Collision

example:
    when index = i % 10
    0 : 0
    1 : 1
    2 : [2,12,22,32] <=== Linked List
